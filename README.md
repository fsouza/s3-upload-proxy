# s3-upload-proxy

[![Build Status](https://github.com/fsouza/s3-upload-proxy/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fsouza/s3-upload-proxy/actions?query=branch:main+workflow:Build)

Tool for proxying HTTP uploads to S3 buckets and Elemental MediaStore
Containers (added later, bad naming :D). Useful for private network protected environments.

## Running locally

Make sure you have [latest Go](https://golang.org/doc/install), then make sure
you have AWS credentials properly configured (s3-upload-proxy uses the [default
credential provider
chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default),
so you can use environment variables or file-based configuration).

Having Go and AWS credentials, just set the environment variable
`BUCKET_NAME`, build and start the process:

```
% export BUCKET_NAME=some-bucket
% go build -o s3-upload-proxy
% ./s3-upload-proxy
```

If you want to use MediaStore, the environment variable `UPLOAD_DRIVER`
should be set to "mediastore" and `BUCKET_NAME` must be set to the container
name on mediastore:

```
% export UPLOAD_DRIVER=mediastore BUCKET_NAME=mediastoretest
% go build -o s3-upload-proxy
% ./s3-upload-proxy
```

## Environment variables

s3-upload-proxy configuration's is defined using the following environment
variables:

| Variable            | Default value | Required | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UPLOAD_DRIVER       | s3            | No       | Upload driver to use (options are "mediastore" or "s3")                          |
| BUCKET_NAME         |               | Yes      | Name of the S3 bucket or the mediastore container (depends on the upload driver) |
| HEALTHCHECK_PATH    | /healthcheck  | No       | Path for healthcheck                                                             |
| HTTP_PORT           | 80            | No       | Port to bind (unsigned int)                                                      |
| LOG_LEVEL           | debug         | No       | Logging level                                                                    |
| CACHE_CONTROL_RULES |               | No       | JSON array with cache control rules (see below)                                  |

## Defining cache-control rules

The tool also allow configuration for cache-control rules. The value of the
environment variable `CACHE_CONTROL_RULES` is a JSON array with the rules. An
example:

```
% export CACHE_CONTROL_RULES='[{"regexp":".mp4$","value":"public, max-age=3600"},{"regexp":".ts$","value":"public, max-age=2, s-maxage=999999"},{"regexp":".m3u8$","value":"private"}]'
```

Notice that the extension must include the dot.
